## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive dashboard built with a modern tech stack. It provides a user-friendly interface and dynamic data visualization. The dashboard is designed to help users track various metrics and KPIs in real-time.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack used in this project includes:

- **Refine React**: A React-based framework for building data-intensive applications. It provides a set of hooks and components to build CRUD interfaces easily.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications. It enables features like server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types. It helps to write safer code and provides better developer tooling.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces. It provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs.
- **Shadcn UI**: A UI library for building high-quality, accessible design systems. It provides a set of pre-built components that can be used to build complex user interfaces.
